# Simple Review Fetcher

#### Project Goal
Provide an easy to use method of fetching, caching, and displaying business reviews from the top directories.

#### Example Use Case
A web designer needs to add dynamic reviews to a marketing website that has existing constraints on the view layer.

#### Philosophy
In spirit of the name, the primary requirement of this project is simplicity. It is trivial for users to drop this into projects that use commodity shared web hosting environments for production. That means no CLI usage or uncommon language extensions!  

## How to Use
See the `/examples` directory for specific details on implementing this utility in your language of choice.

## Future Project Milestones
#### In no particular order:

+ NodeJS Support
+ Python Support
+ Yelp Review Fetching



## Supported Implementations
